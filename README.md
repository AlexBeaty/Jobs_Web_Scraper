# Jobs_Web_Scraper
A python based job search web scraper.

This notebook contains a program built in python that takes a job title and location and retrieves job information based on using the search criteria on Indeed.co.uk.
Results are saved as csv with the intention that a .py version of this program can be scheduled to run routinely and csv files can accumulate for review / analysis.

There is scope to add to this project in the following:
  - Accumulate jobs from other websites.
  - Filter jobs for repeated entries accross multiple days.
  - Use Pandas to analyse csv files and determine most relevant jobs from search.
  - Create GUI to take user input and view returned job results
